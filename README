Introduction
----------------------------------
This is my up-to-date xmonad configuration file (xmonad.hs).

Installation
----------------------------------
Copy xmonad.hs to your $HOME/.xmonad directory; the icons directory goes some-
where on your disk (I keep it at ~/.xmonad/icons).

You'll probably want to adjust some settings in the top part of xmonad.hs,
especially icon path and font/color settings. Also set your terminal emulator
and favorite programs there.

The 'oldstuff' directory contains older code snippets and color themes.

Dependencies
----------------------------------
# xmonad & xmonad-contrib >= 0.9 (haven't tried pre-0.9 with the newest config)
# dzen
# dmenu (for dmenu_run; you can use another program launcher too, e.g. 
         XMonad.Prompt.Shell which is bound to M-S-p in this config)

Notes
----------------------------------
Please note that my Haskell skills are pretty much non-existent and that this
configuration file is more or less composed of stuff I've found at [1] or else-
where on the web and adapted/personalized. The people who created these configs
deserve the real credit. :P

The icons are mostly from sm4tik's icon theme (see [2]) with the addition of a
few self-made icons to indicate the current tiling algorithm.
